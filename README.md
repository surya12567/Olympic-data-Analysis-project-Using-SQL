# SQL-For-data-Analysis-project

For this blog, I am going to showcase some beginner MySQL skills with a data set I have of Olympic statistics. Normally, I start off a blog post with a question and try and answer that question by combing through the data. This time, and mostly because I want to showcase how to use MySQL queries, I will be asking several small questions about the data, then writing some code to try and see if we can answer it. I think this Olympic data set is interesting, so we should be able to pull out some fun group-bys and aggregations.
